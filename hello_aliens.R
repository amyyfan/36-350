cat("Hello intelligent extraterrestrials!\n
My name is Amy Fan, and I am a student at Carnegie Mellon University (or a human from planet Earth).\n
I recently discovered your planet and I'm curious to learn more about your kind and your world.\n
Earth is an intriguing and magnificent place, and I wonder if your world is comparable!\n
Some questions I have for you:\n
What kind of food do you eat?\n
How do you spend your days?\n
How do you communicate with others?\n
What kinds of rituals or traditions do you follow?\n
I know this may be overwhelming, but I'm eager to hear back.\n
I'd also be happy to answer any questions you have about what it's like on Earth.\n
Thanks!")
